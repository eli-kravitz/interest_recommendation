Model 1: stepwise-sine wave for varying intensity with constant velocity
Model 2: varying intensity with constant velocity
Model 3: constant intensity and stepwise-sine wave for varying velocity
Model 4: constant intensity for varying velocity
Model 5: stepwise-sine wave for varying intensity and stepwise-sine wave for varying velocity 
Model 6: varying intensity and velocity

Truth Files:
The TruthModelData folder contains the target truth files where truth.txt is for sensor 1 and truth2.txt is sensor 2. 
For reference, these are the general profiles. 

Random Scenario:
One random scenario contains the following models with delayed start times [4,1,3,3,1,2,5,3,5,4].
